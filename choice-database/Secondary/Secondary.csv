Cryptocurrencies: A Brief Thematic Review,8/25/2017,"Cryptocurrencies are an area of heightened pecuniary, numismatic, technological, and investment interest, and yet a comprehensive understanding of their theories and foundations is still left wanting among some practitioners and stakeholders. Given the surge of literature on cryptocurrencies (both academic and practitioner), the aim of this brief thematic review is to bring to light several areas of interest where both generalist and specialist attention is required and warranted. It synthesizes and summarizes this salient literature on cryptocurrencies thematically with a view to advancing a more general understanding of their order and purpose.",Critical Blockchain Research Initiative,0,0,1
"The ICO Gold Rush: It's a Scam, It's a Bubble, It's a Super Challenge for Regulators",11/19/2017,"Initial coin offerings typically use blockchain technology to offer tokens that confer various rights in return, most often, for cryptocurrency. They can be seen as a conjunction of crowdfunding and blockchain. Based on a database of over 1000 ICO white papers, we provide a taxonomy of ICOs to increase understanding of their many forms, analyze the various regulatory challenges they pose, and suggest the first steps regulators should consider in response. As our database shows, ICOs are a global phenomenon and the global ICO market is much larger than generally thought, with overall ICO subscriptions estimated to exceed 75 billion USD as at the end of June 2. The US ICO market is significant, but the US doesn’t dominate this market, by any means. Furthermore, many ICOs are offered on the basis of utterly inadequate disclosure of information; more than half the ICO white papers are either silent on the initiators or backers or do not provide contact details, and an even greater share do not elaborate on the applicable law, segregation or pooling of client funds, and the existence of an external auditor. Accordingly, the decision to invest in them often cannot be the outcome of a rational calculus. Hallmarks of a classic speculative bubble are present. At the same time, ICOs provide a new, innovative and potentially important vehicle for raising funds to support innovative ideas and ventures, with the potential for aspects of their underlying structure to have an important impact on fundraising systems and structures in future.","Harvard International Law Journal, Vol. 63, No. 2, 2019",1,0,1
DeFi Protocol Risks: The Paradox of DeFi,8/6/2021,"Decentralized Finance (or “DeFi”) is growing in volume and in importance. DeFi promises cheaper and more open access to financial services by reducing the costs and risks of using centralized intermediaries. DeFi also holds the promise of interoperability across blockchains that could help tear down financial sector silos, greatly promoting innovation and building vibrant financial ecosystems. However, DeFi is not without its challenges, which are understudied. This article does not seek to provide a comprehensive list of DeFi risks but to help readers conceptually understand the drivers behind the risks inherent in DeFi. Many of the risks described above stem from the decentralized nature of blockchains. The goal of automating the delivery of financial services and reducing human dependencies also has the congruent effect of reducing oversight and control. Disintermediating traditional intermediaries reduces high fees and entry friction, but also creates new opportunities for new types of intermediaries. This article discusses some of the new types of risks introduced by DeFi that are inherent to blockchain systems along with traditional types of financial risks in DeFi that manifest in new ways: (i) interconnections with the traditional financial system, (ii) operational risks stemming from underlying blockchains, (iii) smart contract-based vulnerabilities, (iv) other governance and regulatory risks, and (v) scalability challenges. In an effort to remove humans and automate as much as possible through smart contracts, DeFi has introduced or amplified these risks. The growth of DeFi will depend on its ability to navigate and build compatibility with traditional finance and on how laws and regulations respond. Perhaps the biggest challenge of all is that the DeFi ecosystem continues to grow while its underlying base layer (public infrastructure such as Bitcoin or Ethereum) faces growing pains. As DeFi grows in importance and becomes more mainstream, policymakers and industry representatives need to better understand the economic and policy consequences of these new types of risks in order to build regulatory approaches and risk management practices that can support and facilitate a healthy and robust DeFi ecosystem and, ultimately, the financial stability of the greater financial system and real economy.","Regtech, Suptech and Beyond: Innovation and Technology in Financial Services”",0,0,1
Decentralized Finance (DeFi),3/3/2020,"DeFi (‘decentralized finance’) has joined FinTech (‘financial technology’), RegTech (‘regulatory technology’), cryptocurrencies, and digital assets as one of the most discussed emerging technological evolutions in global finance. Yet little is really understood about its meaning, legal implications, and policy consequences. In this article we introduce DeFi, put DeFi in the context of the traditional financial economy, connect DeFi to open banking, and end with some policy considerations. We suggest that decentralization has the potential to undermine traditional forms of accountability and erode the effectiveness of traditional financial regulation and enforcement. At the same time, we find that where parts of the financial services value chain are decentralized, there will be a reconcentration in a different (but possibly less regulated, less visible, and less transparent) part of the value chain. DeFi regulation could, and should, focus on this reconcentrated portion of the value chain to ensure effective oversight and risk control. Rather than eliminating the need for regulation, in fact DeFi requires regulation in order to achieve its core objective of decentralization. Furthermore, DeFi potentially offers an opportunity for the development of an entirely new way to design regulation: the idea of ‘embedded regulation’. Regulatory approaches could be built into the design of DeFi, thus potentially decentralizing both finance and its regulation, in the ultimate expression of RegTech.",Journal of Financial Regulation,0,0,1
The Blockchain Revolution: An Analysis of Regulation and Technology Related to Distributed Ledger Technologies,10/12/2016,"Blockchain is on the verge of revolutionizing how we interact in the digital world. It has far reaching applications from the Financial industry to many other sectors of the economy. The question is what is Blockchain, what are the underlying concepts, what is the current state of technological implementation and the current state of its regulatory landscape. While the aswers to these questions take multiple volumes of articles by a vast array of experts in numerous related fields, in this article we will address these questions and provide some basic answers. For those active in the general Blockchain and Digital currency space, from the academic, technology, industry, legal or other points of view, it is important to have a broad overview of the space in general.",Luther Systems and DLA Piper,0,0,1
The Distributed Liability of Distributed Ledgers: Legal Risks of Blockchain,8/15/2017,"The transformative potential of distributed ledger technology, especially in the financial sector, is attracting enormous interest. Many financial institutions are investing heavily in proof of concept demonstrations and the rollout of pilot applications of DLT technology. Part of the attraction of distributed ledger systems, such as Blockchain, lies in transcending law and regulation. From a technological perspective, DLT is generally seen as offering unbreakable security, immutability and unparalleled transparency, so law and regulation are seen as unnecessary. Yet while the law may be dull and the technology exciting, the impact of the law cannot be simply wished away. With data distributed among many ledgers, legal risk will remain. DLT projects may well be found, by courts, to constitute joint ventures with liability spread across all owners and operators of systems serving as distributed ledgers. Regulators seeking to support appropriate approaches to twenty-first century financial infrastructure must focus on these legal consequences.",University of Illinois Law Review,0,0,1

The Impact of Cryptocurrency Regulation on Trading Markets,7/13/2020,"The meteoric growth of global cryptocurrency markets presents novel challenges to regulators. Some policymakers and scholars warn that regulation will cause trading activity to cross borders into less-regulated jurisdictions—or even smother a promising new financial asset class. Others believe regulatory actions will stimulate activity by providing clarity to market participants. Standing behind this disagreement is a debate about the desirability of either outcome. Some believe that governments should promote development of the cryptocurrency sector within their countries, while others view cryptocurrencies as conduits of illegality and fraud that should be restricted through strict regulation or even outright bans. Yet these debates have, to date, been conducted almost entirely without data concerning the effects of regulation on market activity. As a corrective, we assemble original data on cryptocurrency regulations worldwide and use them to empirically examine movement in trading activity at a number of exchanges following key regulatory announcements.",Journal of Financial Regulation,0,1,1
"A Regulatory Classification of Digital Assets: Toward an Operational Howey Test for Cryptocurrencies, ICOs, and Other Digital Assets",10/17/2018,"Digital assets are hot right now. Whether cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, or initial coin offerings and tokens, this new asset class has captured the imagination of American investors. While it remains to be seen if this phenomenon has staying power, there is no doubt that these assets and their promoters have attracted the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission. But neither Congress nor the SEC has formally elucidated which digital assets are securities and which are not.",Columbia Business Law Review,1,1,1
How Crisis Affects Crypto: Coronavirus as a Test Case,3/23/2020,"Everybody is talking about Cryptocurrencies. These digital tokens, which began as a one-asset market, have swiftly ballooned into a massive and diverse “cryptomarket”. The cryptomarket is still mostly unregulated, but this is about to change, as a presidential executive order on “crypto strategy” reportedly lurks ahead. In light of the expected regulatory changes, two important questions emerge: is there a clear rationale for legal intervention in the cryptomarket? And if so, what type of regulation would be optimal?",Hastings Law Journal,0,1,1
"Bitcoin, Virtual Currencies, and the Struggle of Law and Regulation to Keep Pace",6/15/2018,"At less than a decade old, Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have had a major societal impact, and proven to be a unique payment systems challenge for law enforcement, financial regulatory authorities worldwide, and the investment community. Rapid introduction and diffusion of technological changes throughout society, such as the blockchain that serves as Bitcoin’s crypto-foundation, continue to outpace the ability of law and regulation to keep pace. During 2017 alone, the market price of Bitcoin rose 1,735 percent, from about $970 to $14,292, causing an investor feeding frenzy. As of March 31, 2, a total of 1,595 cryptocurrencies are reported, having an approximate market capitalization of $266.97 billion at that date. A brief history of the fast moving adoption of blockchain-based technology is provided, along with a look at the efforts of regulators to keep up with the staggering worldwide growth in the usage of virtual currencies.",Marquette Law Review 447,0,1,1
"Delaware’s Dominance, Wyoming’s Dare. New Challenge, Same Outcome?",2/18/2021,"Despite increasing criticism, Delaware’s dominance in corporate law has not experienced a significant decline: as of today, 67.8 percent of Fortune 500 companies are still incorporated in its jurisdiction. Nevada is known as Delaware’s most important competitor, with an aggressive strategy that has overridden the efforts of any other jurisdiction.

Payments and the Evolution of Stablecoins and CBDCs in the Global Economy,4/24/2023,"The U.S. payments system has proven to be vibrant, adaptable, and innovative. And yet, it has also revealed areas in need of urgent improvement. Lower-income households and communities of color continue to struggle to access the full suite of benefits available within a rapidly digitizing payments system. The underlying payments infrastructure required to move money from one bank account to another is often slow and costly. And the international payment system imposes transaction costs and delays for cross-border money transmission, increasing pressure on the continuing capacity of the US dollar to maintain monetary preeminence in global trade.",Vanderbilt Law Research Paper,0,0,1
Crypto-Enforcement Around the World,12/2/2020,"The blockchain revolution in capital and financial markets attracted the attention of enforcement agencies in many jurisdictions. This Article elaborates the results of an international enforcement survey of the Blockchain and Fintech Research Program of the Rutgers Center for Corporate Law and Governance. It provides a detailed analysis of enforcement in major crypto-market jurisdictions. The data suggest that, despite an extended network of agreements facilitating international cooperation, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) maintains its historically active enforcement posture. The SEC brings more enforcement actions against cryptoasset issuers, broker-dealers, crypto-exchanges, and other digital-asset market participants than most other major crypto-jurisdictions, as well as the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission. SEC enforcement results in considerably more serious penalties.",Southern California Law Review Postscript,1,1,1
A Comprehensive Approach to Crypto Regulation,10/19/2022,"Regulation of cryptocurrency is a key policymaking issue of our time. There are many challenges associated with developing and applying legal frameworks to cryptocurrency, as the technology, business practices, and uses of cryptocurrency vary significantly from traditional financial services. Moreover, the ecosystem exhibits a rapid speed of innovation and very high level of complexity. Nevertheless, regulating cryptocurrency, particularly as it relates to users, is essential to achieve sufficient investor and consumer protection, as well as to provide the clarity that innovators need to build their businesses.",The University of Pennsylvania Journal of Business Law,0,1,1
Imperfect Digital Certificates of Provenance - A Categorical Risk-Based Approach to Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs),4/19/2022,"Non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) are an emerging digital asset that has captured global attention with multi-million-dollar price tags for seemingly basic pixelated JPEG files. In March 2021, British auction house Christie’s sold a digital artwork, ‘Everydays: The First 5,000 Days’, by artist Mike Winkelmann (“Beeple”) for the Ether equivalent of $69.3 million, making it the third-most expensive artwork by a living artist.1 Beeple’s sale was by no means alone—Sotheby's sold an NFT collection of 101 ‘Bored Apes’ for $24.4 million;2 CryptoPunk #7804, one of 10,000 unique ‘CryptoPunk’ NFTs sold for $7.56 million,3 and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s first-ever tweet sold for $2.9 million as an NFT.4 NFT sales in the first-half of 2021 have already exceeded $2.5 billion,5 and, as of October 2021, the total value of NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain is estimated to be at least $14.3 billion.6 On one hand, NFTs may be poised to revolutionize creative industries and drastically alter consumer interaction with digital media.7 On the other hand, the NFT market is simultaneously both ripe for speculative investment and vulnerable to criminal activity.8 To date, there appears to be no consensus on the regulation of NFTs, neither from the perspective of generally applicable laws, regulatory capture under existing financial market regulation, nor the implementation of new digital asset laws. This paper attempts to highlight several pertinent dangers of NFTs, from a profound misunderstanding of what an NFT transaction entails, their bubble-like pricing, to various criminal activity concerns. By illustrating how existing laws and regulations may not fully capture nor address these dangers, as well as the potential oversight of NFTs in newly proposed digital asset laws, this paper proposes a categorial approach to regulating NFTs, by reducing the current (and likely future) use-cases of NFTs to their constituent categories and in turn, suggesting the most appropriate regulatory approach to each. Ultimately, given the (potential) wide-ranging use-cases of NFTs, this paper proposes that the NFT’s intended use-case described in broad categorical terms, or more aptly, its underlying reference asset and simultaneous conveyance, or lack thereof, should dictate the regulatory approach.",Colorado Technology Law Journal,1,1,1
When the Means Undermine the End: the Leviathan of Securities Law and Enforcement in Digital-Asset Markets,9/11/2021,"The focus of this Article is the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the major capital-market watchdog. Created in the wake of the Great Depression, the SEC pursues a ternary set of objectives, including protecting investors, maintaining efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation. This Article examines a fundamental disconnect between the objectives of the SEC and the actual outcome of its policies in digital-asset markets—the agency’s enforcement efforts under the mantra of protecting investors and providing digital-asset markets with more information have produced an environment with less information. This disconnect between the SEC’s means and ends is relevant not only to cryptoasset investors but also to other purchasers such as consumers and users.",The Stanford Journal of Blockchain Law & Policy,1,1,1
When Does a Nonfungible Token (NFT) Become a Security?,3/12/2022,"Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) gained prominence in the news cycle during March 2021when $69 million was paid in a cryptocurrency known as ether for a single piece of unique digital art titled “Everydays – The First 5000 Days.” Regulation of NFTs is complicated by the fact that the technology encompasses so many varied applications. Therefore, it is the particular use of a given NFT that will determine its appropriate regulatory regime, since it may take the form of a collectible, data associated with a physical item, financial instrument, or a permanent record associated with a person, such as marriage license, or property deed. Just as in the case of digital art in the form of NFTs, our laws and regulations are in a constant struggle to keep pace with rapid introduction and diffusion of technological changes. Unlike digital or cryptocurrencies which are fungible, NFTs are not. The effective regulation of U.S. securities markets has a significant impact on capital formation, job creation, economic security, and growth of both the American and global economies. In recent years, the advent of the Internet has created novel regulatory challenges for the SEC.",Georgia State University Law Review,1,1,1
Embedded Supervision: How to Build Regulation into Decentralised Finance,6/8/2022,"The emergence of so-called “decentralised finance” (DeFi) and a shadow financial system of cryptocurrency exchanges and stablecoin issuers raises the challenge of how to apply technology-neutral regulation so that similar risks are subject to the same rules. This paper makes the case for embedded supervision, ie a regulatory framework that provides for compliance in decentralised markets to be automatically monitored by reading the market’s ledger. This reduces the need for firms to actively collect, verify and deliver data. The paper explores the conditions under which distributed ledger data may be used to monitor compliance. To this end, a decentralised market is modelled that replaces today’s intermediary-based verification of legal data with blockchain-enabled credibility based on economic consensus. The key results set out the conditions under which the market’s economic consensus would be strong enough to guarantee that transactions are economically final, so that supervisors can trust the distributed ledger’s data. The paper concludes with a discussion of the legislative and operational requirements that would promote low-cost supervision and a level playing field for small and large firms.",CESifo Working Paper,0,0,1
"South Cherry Street, LLC v. Hennessee Group LLC: Investors' Desperate Plea for Second Circuit Standards",11/30/2012,"In South Cherry Street, LLC v. Hennessee Group LLC, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit considered whether South Cherry Street, an investment fund, could bring a securities fraud claim against its investment adviser, Hennessee Group, for recommending that the fund invest in a Ponzi scheme. The Second Circuit dismissed South Cherry Street’s securities fraud claim because South Cherry Street failed to plead sufficient facts to meet the scienter requirement. The Court erred in finding that South Cherry Street did not meet the scienter requirements promulgated under Rule 10b-5 or the Second Circuit because Hennessee Group’s failure of duty to monitor established scienter. Despite the Court’s failure to find scienter, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals enunciated the right standard, which should be followed by other circuits because it strikes the appropriate balance between deterring fraud and preventing illegitimate claims.",Journal of Business & Technology Law,1,1,0

What Constitutes a Security and Requirements Relating to the Offer and Sales of Securities and Exemptions From Registration Associated Therewith,4/27/2017,"Compliance with the rules and regulations for the offer and sale of securities is complicated; each and every transaction is required to either be (a) registered with the SEC; or (b) exempt from registration under the Securities Act. As such, a competent securities attorney should always be contacted prior to any offer or sale of securities to determine and confirm that all applicable rules and requirements are being followed. Failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the Securities Act can lead to an issuer being subject to civil and criminal penalties and fines and can further create rescission rights for investors in the non-compliant offering. Keep in mind that securities are often governed by both federal and state law, and that each state has their own requirements, all of which should be confirmed prior to proceeding with the offer or sale of any securities.",American Bar Association Business Law Group,1,1,0
