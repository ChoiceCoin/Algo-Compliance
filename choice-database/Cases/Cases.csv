SEC v. Howey,SCOTUS,1946,"The test of whether there is an ""investment contract"" under the Securities Act is whether the scheme involves an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others; and, if that test be satisfied, it is immaterial whether the enterprise is speculative or nonspeculative, or whether there is a sale of property with or without intrinsic value.","In Securities and Exchange Commission v. W. J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946), the Supreme Court held that the sale of land and service contracts was an ""investment contract"" under the Securities Act of 1933. The Court found that using the mails and interstate commerce to offer and sell these contracts violated §5 of the Act. This case established the Howey test to determine whether an instrument qualifies as an investment contract: it involves a scheme where a person invests money in a common enterprise and expects profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party. This test is fundamental for assessing the applicability of federal securities laws.",SEC,1,0,0
SEC v. Ralston Purina Co.,SCOTUS,1953,"A corporation offering ""key employees"" equity stock shares is eligible for a transaction-based exemption from securities registration under Section 4(1) [Now Section 4(a)(2)] of the Securities Act of 1933. ","Without complying with the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, a corporation offered shares of its stock to a number of its ""key employees.""

"SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc.",SCOTUS,1963,"A financial adviser may be required by the SEC, without a showing of intent to deceive, to reveal self-dealing that may affect clients. ","Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Securities and Exchange Commission may obtain an injunction compelling a registered investment adviser to disclose to his clients a practice of purchasing shares of a security for his own account shortly before recommending that security for long-term investment and then immediately selling his own shares at a profit upon the rise in the market price following the recommendation, since such a practice ""operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client"" within the meaning of the Act.

Tcherepnin v. Knight,SCOTUS,1967,"Withdrawable capital share in state-chartered savings and loan association held to be a ""security"" within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

"SEC v. National Securities, Inc.",D.C. Circuit,1969,"The deception alleged here has affected stockholders' decisions in a way not unlike that involved in a typical cash sale or share exchange, and, in light of the broad anti-fraud purposes of § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5, which apply ""in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,"" exchanges by Producers' shareholders of their old stock for shares in the new company are ""purchases"" within the meaning of that statutory language. ","The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought suit against respondent National Securities and persons associated with it, alleging violations of § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and of SEC's Rule 10b-5, arising out of misrepresentations and omissions of material facts in communications sent to shareholders of Producers Life Insurance Co., in an attempt to secure approval of a merger between that company and an insurance firm controlled by National Securities.",SEC,1,1,0
SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co.,2nd Ciruit,1968,Insider trading violated federal securities law and remained the leading case on insider trading for a decade. ,"SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co. is a landmark case decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that established key standards for insider trading laws under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5. This case defined what constitutes material inside information, how it should be disclosed, and what makes a statement misleading. It was the first time a federal court ruled that insider trading violated federal securities law, and it remained a leading case on this issue for a decade. While the U.S. Supreme Court has adopted some of its principles and rejected others, the case continues to be a significant topic of scholarly discussion.",SEC,0,1,0
"SEC v. Glenn W. Turner Enterprises, Inc.",9th Circuit,1973,"The Court concludes that the efforts which are significant to the success or failure of this enterprise are those of defendants and that, consequently, their promotion constitutes an offer of an investment contract within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. ","The court stated concluded, the decision in this case does not seek to fundamentally change the definition of a security, nor does it deviate significantly from the Supreme Court's definition of an investment contract established in Howey. The court held that applying the requirement for profits to come 'solely' from the efforts of others in a rigid manner would produce unrealistic outcomes in this context. Therefore, a more flexible approach is warranted.",SEC,1,1,0
"SEC v. Koscot Interplanetary, Inc.",5th Circuit,1974,"Investment contracts exist when the managerial efforts, not the investor’s, aresubstantial and critical, and the success or failure of the business is contingent upon them. ","The court's ruling is specifically applied to schemes where promoters maintain direct control over crucial managerial functions and where investors' profits are tightly linked to the success of the promoters' plan, distinguishing these from conventional franchise arrangements where promoters have only indirect control. The court acknowledged Justice Brennan’s caution about not assuming federal regulation is achieved merely because it is desirable, emphasizing that the test used must align with the purposes of the Securities Acts. This flexible test is designed to address various schemes promising profits and is particularly suited to cover the problematic promotional scheme at issue.",SEC,1,1,0
United Housing Foundation v. Forman,SCOTUS,1975,The Securities Act does not recognize commercial contracts in stock as securities where the transaction’s purpose is not investment for profit. ,"A transaction labeled a stock purchase is not a security transaction unless it (1) provides the right to dividends dependent on receipt of profits, (2) confers voting rights and (3) is negotiable. The respondents, 57 residents of Co-op City, a large cooperative housing project in New York City, sued on behalf of all apartment owners and the housing corporation, alleging violations of the Securities Acts in connection with the sale of shares in the cooperative. They claimed that an information bulletin issued by Co-op City’s developers falsely assured that the developers would cover future cost increases, such as inflation. Under the Mitchell-Lama Act, which encourages private developers to build low-cost housing through state support, the developers, including United Housing Foundation (UHF) and its subsidiaries, must operate on a nonprofit basis. To buy an apartment in Co-op City, a prospective resident must purchase shares of Riverbay stock, which are non-transferable and come with specific restrictions. The petitioners argued that this stock did not qualify as a security under federal law. The District Court agreed and dismissed the complaint, but the Court of Appeals reversed the decision, holding that the shares were securities due to the expectation of financial returns from the cooperative’s operations. However, the Supreme Court held that the shares in question did not constitute securities under the Securities Acts and affirmed the District Court’s dismissal of the case.","United Housing Foundation, Inc.",1,1,0
"Curran v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith, Inc.",SCOTUS,1982,A private party may maintain an action for damages caused by a violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). ,"The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), which governs commodity futures trading, was significantly revised by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974. This Act established the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which took over regulatory and enforcement responsibilities from the Secretary of Agriculture and gained the authority to award reparations for CEA violations. However, the 1974 Act, like its predecessors, did not address private judicial remedies for those harmed by CEA violations. The cases in question involved investors suing their futures commission merchants or brokers for antifraud violations, and speculators suing the New York Mercantile Exchange and its officials, as well as futures commission merchants, for damages due to alleged unlawful price manipulation. The District Courts ruled against the plaintiffs, but the Courts of Appeals recognized implied rights of action under the CEA. The Supreme Court held that private parties are indeed entitled to seek damages for violations of the CEA.",Curran,1,1,0
"Stenger v. R.H. Love Galleries, Inc.",7th Circuit,1984,Plaintiff's plea that we establish a regulatory framework for the sale of art cannot be answered through the securities laws. ,"The court ruled that the plaintiff’s investment in paintings did not qualify as an ""investment contract"" under the Securities Acts, as it failed to meet the criteria for a common enterprise. The court found no horizontal commonality because the plaintiff did not pool funds or share profits with other investors. It also rejected vertical commonality, noting that the plaintiff’s financial interests were not interwoven with those of the defendants. Therefore, the court affirmed the district court's decision, concluding that the sale of paintings did not constitute a security under the relevant laws.","R.H. Love Galleries, Inc.",1,1,0
Landreth Timber Co. v. Landreth,SCOTUS,1985,"Regardless of the stockholder’s role in the corporation management, a sale of shares of stock falls under the protection of the securities laws.  ","The Supreme Court ruled that the stock sold in this case qualifies as a ""security"" under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The court rejected the ""sale of business"" doctrine, which had been used to argue that the transaction was a commercial venture rather than an investment. The court held that despite the purchasers gaining full managerial control and the stock being part of a business acquisition, it still fell within the definition of a security.",Landreth Timber Co.,1,0,0
Reves v. Ernst & Young,SCOTUS,1990,"The demand notes issued by the Co-Op fall under the note category of instruments that are securities. Reves v. Ernst & Young, 494 U.S. 56 (1990), was a Supreme Court case that addressed whether ""uncollateralized and uninsured promissory notes payable on demand by the holder"" issued by the Farmers Cooperative of Arkansas and Oklahoma were considered securities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. ","The Court ruled that such promissory notes do qualify as securities. It employed the ""family resemblance"" test to determine if the notes were akin to traditional securities like bonds and whether they were issued for investment purposes rather than ordinary commercial transactions. This ruling clarified that certain types of promissory notes can fall under federal securities regulations.",Reves,1,1,0
SEC v. Zandford,SCOTUS,2004,"The Court held that assuming that the complaint's allegations were true, the securities broker's conduct was in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. ","Noting that Zandford's practices were not independent events, the Court found that each sale was made to further his fraudulent scheme and that each was deceptive because it was neither authorized by, nor disclosed to, the Woods. In this case, an elderly man, William Wood, and his mentally retarded daughter opened a joint investment account with a broker who was granted full discretion and a general power of attorney. After Mr. Wood's death, it was discovered that the broker had used the funds for personal purposes. The broker was indicted for federal wire fraud, and the SEC filed a civil suit alleging violations of § 10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the SEC, but the Fourth Circuit reversed, arguing that the fraud did not involve the purchase or sale of securities in a way that affected market integrity or investor understanding. The Supreme Court held that, assuming the allegations were true, the broker's conduct was indeed ""in connection with the purchase or sale of any security."" The Court emphasized that the Securities Exchange Act should be interpreted broadly to support its goals of maintaining honest markets and promoting investor confidence, thus supporting the SEC's position.",SEC,0,1,0
"SEC v. Merchant Capital, LLC",11th Circuit,2007,"Partnership interests in a registered limited liability partnership (""RLLP"") were ""investment contracts"" within the definition of ""securities"" under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), and therefore covered by the Federal securities laws.","The 11th Circuit held that the RLLP interests qualify as investment contracts and are thus covered by federal securities laws, reversing the district court's judgment on this matter. Additionally, they found that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions in marketing these interests, contrary to the district court's conclusion. The district court, having been in a better position to address issues of scienter and remedies, should reconsider these matters on remand, taking into account our findings. Consequently, the 11th Circuit  vacated the district court's previous determinations regarding scienter and remedies and remand for further consideration.",SEC,1,1,0
